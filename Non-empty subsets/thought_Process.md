### Problem Understanding:

We need to find the minimum number \( K \) such that there exists a non-empty subset of array \( A \) for which the bitwise OR of all its elements is equal to \( K \).

### Key Insights:

1. **Bitwise OR Operation**:
    - The bitwise OR operation combines bits from multiple numbers, setting a bit to 1 if any of the corresponding bits of the operands are 1.
    - For example, if we have numbers `3` (binary `011`) and `5` (binary `101`), their OR is `7` (binary `111`).

2. **Subset OR**:
    - The bitwise OR of a subset will always have a bit set if at least one element in the subset has that bit set.
    - This means, in the worst case, the OR of the entire array gives the maximum possible result.

### Simplified Thought Process:

3. **Smallest \( K \) Concept**:
    - To find the smallest \( K \) that can be achieved by any subset of \( A \), think about the simplest subsets, which are single elements of the array.
    - If you take a single element from \( A \), the bitwise OR of that subset (which is just one element) will be the element itself.

4. **Smallest Element**:
    - The smallest element in \( A \) is the smallest possible result of any subset's OR because a single-element subset will have an OR equal to that element.
    - Therefore, the minimum \( K \) is simply the smallest element in the array.

### Detailed Example Analysis:

Let's analyze the provided example to see how this approach works:

#### Example 1:

**Input**:
```
2
4
1 3 5 7
3
2 6 14
```

1. **Test Case 1**:
    - Array: [1, 3, 5, 7]
    - The smallest element in the array is `1`.
    - So, \( K \) is `1` because there's a subset (just the element `1`) whose OR is `1`.

2. **Test Case 2**:
    - Array: [2, 6, 14]
    - The smallest element in the array is `2`.
    - So, \( K \) is `2` because there's a subset (just the element `2`) whose OR is `2`.

### Corrected Approach:

With this understanding, the approach becomes straightforward:

1. **Read the input**:
    - Number of test cases.
    - For each test case, read the array.
    
2. **Find the minimum element**:
    - Iterate through the array to find the smallest element.

3. **Output the smallest element**:
    - This smallest element is our \( K \).

### Implementation in Java:

Here is the Java code implementing this approach:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MinimumKForBitwiseOR {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int T = scanner.nextInt();
        while (T-- > 0) {
            int N = scanner.nextInt();
            int[] A = new int[N];

            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                A[i] = scanner.nextInt();
            }

            // Calculate the minimum element in the array
            int K = A[0];
            for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
                if (A[i] < K) {
                    K = A[i];
                }
            }

            // Print the result for this test case
            System.out.println(K);
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(N) \) per test case because we only need to make a single pass through the array to find the minimum element.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) additional space because we only use a few extra variables to store the minimum element and loop counters.

By focusing on finding the smallest element, we efficiently solve the problem with minimal computation.
